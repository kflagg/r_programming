# Syllabus {-}

Statistics and Data Science are fields that increasingly require computational
problem-solving skills and bespoke solutions that are not implemented in
point-and-click software. Thus, programming languages developed for
scientific computing have become ubiquitous, and the free R language [@baser]
is now central to many Statistics courses and jobs.

Unfortunately, Statistics education often focuses exclusively on using R as a
tool for implementing and demonstrating statistical concepts; this does a
disservice to students who are left to fend for themselves when presented
tasks or error messages that do not fit into their set of familiar R
experiences. Students in Statistics programs need to be R programmers, not
just R users. Therefore, the goal of this course is to teach you to think like
a programmer.

This course will teach you both R and the concepts of object-oriented
programming. If you are an aspiring statistician who wants to improve in
either or both of those areas, this course is for you. If you have no R or
programming experience, you will get a solid foundation in both. If you have
used R before but had no formal programming training, this course will make
you a much more effective R programmer. If you have had training as an
object-oriented programmer, you will learn the R language and how to apply
object-oriented programming to statistical analysis.

## Learning Outcomes {-}

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Explain how computers interpret and execute code.
- Evaluate conditional statements manually and in R.
- Describe and implement functions, objects, and methods in R.
- Develop conceptual models of programs and translate them into code.
- Debug your own programs and implement error/warning messages in R.

## Materials {-}

Naturally, you will need a recent version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

The primary text for this course is _R for Data Science_ [@r4ds]. The
__required__ readings will be assigned from the most up-to-date online version
of [r4ds](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), but you may purchase a physical copy
if you wish. This book teaches a useful and standard set of R tools, and is
organized to emphasize analysis and communication more than programming (but
the brief section on programming is excellent). Please note that we will cover the
topics in a very different order from how they are presented in the book and I
will frequently point out the differences in pedagogical philosophy between
statisticians and computer scientists.

I will adapt additional material from _The Art of R Programming_ [@matloff].
This is a great reference for the basic features and programming constructs of
R, but acquiring your own copy is __optional__.

## Course Outline {-}

This course is in development, but the following is a tentative list of topics that will be included. Each section begins with assigned reading material (which
should be read first), then includes additional notes elaborating upon the
important concepts or covering additional topics not included in the reading,
and ends with exercises to be done as homework.

1. [R Code][R Code]
    - Input, output, running code
2. [Data Types and Operations][Data Types and Operations]
    - Basic variable types (character, numeric, logical)
    - Mathematical operations
    - Special values (`NULL`, `Inf`, `NaN`)
3. [Data Structures][Data Structures]
    - Vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, data frames
4. [Conditional Execution and Loops][Conditional Execution and Loops]
5. Functions
6. Applying Functions
7. Objects and Methods
8. Introduction to Packages
